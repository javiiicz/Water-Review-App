Water Reviews is an IOS app built with the Swift programming language. The app lets users create reviews with sliders, an image, and a description. This review is then posted in the explore page for everyone with the app to see. Apart from SwiftUI, the project uses Firebase libraries such as FirebaseAuth, FirebaseStorage, and FirebaseDatastore for the server side functionality.
